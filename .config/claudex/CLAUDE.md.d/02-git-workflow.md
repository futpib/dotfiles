# Git Workflow Best Practices

- Use descriptive branch names that indicate the purpose of the changes
- If Claude made changes to code, it may include co-authorship
- Commit message guidelines:
  - Describe the changes being made, focusing on the "why" rather than the "what"
  - Keep first line concise (50-72 characters)
  - Add detailed explanation in subsequent paragraphs if needed
