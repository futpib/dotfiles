# Memory Management Guidelines

- When asked to "remember" something, update the appropriate CLAUDE.md file with the relevant information
- Memory storage principles:
  - Store **patterns and strategies** rather than specific instances or data points
  - Focus on **reusable logic** and **process knowledge** that remains useful over time
  - Avoid storing **ephemeral data** (specific MR numbers, dates, etc.) that becomes outdated
  - Remember **how to do things** rather than **what was done**
  - Think about **future utility** when deciding what to remember
  - When updating memory, also review session interruptions and workflow issues to identify patterns worth remembering
